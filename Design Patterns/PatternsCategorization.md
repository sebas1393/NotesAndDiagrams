# Gamma Categorization

## Creational Patterns

- Deal with the creation(construction) of objects.
- Explicit (constructor) vs Implicit (Dependency Injection, reflection, etc.)
- Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step).

## Structural Patterns

- Concerned with the structure (e.g. class members).
- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface.
- Stress the importance of good API design.

## Behavioral Patterns
- They are all different; no central theme.
